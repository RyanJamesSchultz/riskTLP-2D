# riskTLP-2D

We present a Matlab-based functional enviroment, riskTLP-2D that simulates risk-based thresholds for use in defining traffic light protocols.

These files are a collection of matlab programs and scripts: scriptRISK.m creates the datastructure and then scriptPLOTRISK.m plots the output results.
